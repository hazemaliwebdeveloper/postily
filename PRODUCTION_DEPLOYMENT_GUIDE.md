# 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## 📋 **DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS OVERVIEW**

Based on your configuration, you have multiple production deployment options:

### **1. Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)** - Recommended
### **2. Docker Container Deployment** - Full control
### **3. Railway Full Stack** - Simple setup
### **4. Self-Hosted VPS** - Maximum control

- Memory optimization: 6GB-8GB allocation
- pnpm package manager (fastest)
- Workspace-based architecture
- Production-ready Docker setup
